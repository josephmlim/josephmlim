# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joe
ðŸŒ±I am currently learning how to code at the CoGrammar Skills Bootcamp. 
I have a keen interest in problem solving and data. I am attracted to the logical way of thinking required to find simple solutions to complex problems. This was a key factor for my choice of degree and I am keen to focus on this element in a professional environment. 

## My current role
I am working as a Data Quality Assistant for Twenty7tec, a market leader in the provision of technology to mortgage advisers and lenders. One of the leading B2B fintech 
businesses in the UK.
I am responsible for:
- Preparing data, checking for potential of errors and entering data onto the system, using Standard Operating 
Procedures, in line with agreed SLAâ€™s.
- Addressing and resolving any potential inaccuracies with lenders for clarification of supplied information.
- Answering internal and external partners and customers questions and enquiries referring to the appropriate 
team.
- Testing system changes and upgrades by inputting new data and reviewing output.
â€¢ Assisting with projects, when required.
