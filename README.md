# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joe
ðŸŒ±I am currently learning how to code at the CoGrammar Skills Bootcamp. 
I have a keen interest in problem solving and data. I am attracted to the logical way of thinking required to find simple solutions to complex problems. This was a key factor for my choice of degree and I am keen to focus on this element in a professional environment.
